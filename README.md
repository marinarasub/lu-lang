**UPDATE**: I haven't updated this repository, but I've actually been working on this quite a bit offline! Please let me know if you're interested and check out the link above ;)

## Old Description

`Hello, world!` I'm working a a general purpose language for fun. Please feel free to contribute or give feedback. It's still very much a work in progress.

The goal is to build an intuitive, minimal code required, statically typed language with a slightly different approach to typing from OOP or functional style.

The parser is hand-written recursive descent, I'll update with a formal grammar specification once it's more mature.

The current interpreter/compiler in progress in written using C++11.
